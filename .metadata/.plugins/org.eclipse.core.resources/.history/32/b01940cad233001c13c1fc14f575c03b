@Register map
@R0 - N, returns class
@R1 - points
@R2 - label
@R3 - sample, K
@R4 - Array of distance
@R5 - Sample X1
@R6 - Sample Y1
@R7 -

@Variables map
@ .lcomm distance - Contains all the distance. Currently set for N = 100
@ Equates
classification:
@ PUSH / save (only those) registers which are modified by your function
		PUSH {R1-R7,LR}
@ parameter registers need not be saved.

@ write asm function body here
		PUSH {R7}
		BL LOADSAMPLE @Note, R7 is temp used
		POP {R7}
		LDR R0,[R0]
		LDR R4, =DISTANCE
		BL SETDISTANCE


@ prepare value to return (class) to C program in R0
@ the #5 here is an arbitrary result
		MOV R0, #5
@ POP / restore original register values. DO NOT save or restore R0. Why?
		POP {R1-R7,LR}

@ return to C program
		BX	LR

@R0 - N(Int)
@R1 - Points(Array)
@R3 - K samples(int)
@R4 - Dist(Array)
@R5 - Sample X1
@R6 - Sample Y1
@R7 - X1, X2
SETDISTANCE:

		LDR R7, [R1], #4
		SUB R5, R7
		MLU R4, R5, R5 @Store (x1-x2)^2 into Dist
		LDR R7, [R1], #4




LOADSAMPLE:
		@Load Sample X,Y,K
		LDR R5, [R3], #4
		LDR R6, [R3], #4
		LDR R7, [R3], #4
		MOV R3, R7
		BX LR

@ you could write your code without SUBROUTINE
SUBROUTINE:

		BX LR

@label: .word value
K: .word 1
@.lcomm label num_bytes
.lcomm DISTANCE 400 @Set for N = 100
