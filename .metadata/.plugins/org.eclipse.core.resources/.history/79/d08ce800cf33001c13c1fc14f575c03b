@Register map
@R0 - N, returns class
@R1 - points
@R2 - label
@R3 - sample, K
@R4 - Array of distance
@R5 - Sample X1
@R6 - Sample X2
@R7 -

@Variables map
@ .lcomm distance - Contains all the distance. Currently set for N = 100
@ Equates
classification:
@ PUSH / save (only those) registers which are modified by your function
		PUSH {R1-R7}
@ parameter registers need not be saved.

@ write asm function body here
		PUSH {LR}
		BL LOADSAMPLE
		POP {LR}
		LDR R0,[R0]
		LDR R4, =DISTANCE
		PUSH {LR}
		@BL SETDISTANCE
		POP {LR}

@ prepare value to return (class) to C program in R0
@ the #5 here is an arbitrary result
		MOV R0, #5
@ POP / restore original register values. DO NOT save or restore R0. Why?
		POP {R1-R7}

@ return to C program
		BX	LR
@R0 - N
@R1 - Points
@R3 - K samples
@R4 - Dist
@R5 - Sample X1
@R6 - Sample X2
SETDISTANCE:


LOADSAMPLE:
		@Load Sample X,Y,K
		LDR R5, [R3], #4
		LDR R6, [R3], #4
		LDR R3, [R3], #4
		BX LR

@ you could write your code without SUBROUTINE
SUBROUTINE:

		BX LR

@label: .word value
K: .word 1
@.lcomm label num_bytes
.lcomm DISTANCE 400 @Set for N = 100
